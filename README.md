## WeatherPy Project

## Project Description:

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a 
[simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a 
representative model of weather across world cities.

## My objective :

Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Notes :

* Included a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Included Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* Randomly selected **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Created a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
* Wrote description of three observable trends based on the data.
